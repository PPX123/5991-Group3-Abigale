# INTRODUCTION TO YOUR CONSULTANTS REPORT
## BACKGROUND
IT consultants work in a variety of contexts. They may be partners in an IT consulting firm or they may be part of an organisation’s internal consulting team. They may be technical specialists, management specialists or a combination of the two.  
  
This assessment is designed to help you gain the critical, analytical, and communication skills expected of an IT professional (technical or managerial) who can operate as a consultant.

## YOUR CLIENT AND THEIR REQUIREMENTS
Typically, a client asks a consultant to recommend how to solve a problem for them. The consultant then:
+ helps the client articulate the real problem,
+ researches the evidence on the relevant topics,
+ analyses the evidence s/he finds,
+ develops options on how to solve the problem,
+ makes recommendations (i.e. presents the evidence persuasively) to her/his client, in an oral presentation and a written report.  
  
Your client is The Newtown Bank. The bank’s profits are declining and it is particularly concerned by the role of its IT infrastructure in this. The bank needs a consultant to carry out the five steps above with a particular focus on three techniques that might help them:
1. Service-oriented enterprise and IT architecture, and microservices
2. Sourcing external services (outsourcing) including cloud services
3. IT governance, service management and DevOps

Increasing profitability with IT infrastructure: Client Brief for Consultants Report** describes the Newtown Bank’s business, corporate structure, IT infrastructure, the problem and its causes, the IT goals and strategies and its requirements for your Consultants Report.
